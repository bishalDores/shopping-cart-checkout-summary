This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Shopping cart checkout summary
This project is not mine. It was done by Mr. [Paul Hanna](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnj8dl6NWgASf4kKZLuuwfw). I used it as one of my education materials to learn react redux (specially redux part). Look out for few things in these projects (consider it as user story):
* Tooltip on 'pickup savings'
* Collapsible sections in item details and apply promo code
* type 'DISCOUNT' in promo code input file and press apply. You will see changes in Estimated total price.

> Tax Calculation : (total + pickupSavings) * 0.0875 (I guess 0.0875 is california sales tax rate) <br>
Estimated total calculation: total + pickupSavings + tax <br>
Discount Calculation: Estimated total * 0.9

#### Run this project: 
Clone the repo and go to your project directory and then write following commands: <br>
```
  npm install 
  npm start
```
